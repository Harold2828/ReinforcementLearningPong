# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning with the Basic Pong Game

A hands-on project combining **classic arcade gameplay** with the power of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.  
This setup demonstrates how an AI agent can learn to master a Pong game through trial-and-error, rewards, and intelligent adaptation.

## 🎮 Pong Game (Frontend)

- 📂 **[View Pong Game README](PongGame/README.md)**

Built using **PhaserJS**, this lightweight browser-based game simulates a simplified Pong environment, ideal for testing RL algorithms and observing their performance in real time.

## 🖥️ Server Side (Backend)
- 📂 **[View Server README](Server/README.md)**

The backend is developed using **Python 3.12.2** and **Flask 3.1.0**, with custom support for **WebSockets** to allow real-time communication between the AI agent and the game environment.
